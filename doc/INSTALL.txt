= Installation Notes =

If you are working on a development version of tdl and/or running tdl from a local python installation you need the following:

* The following are some of the core (ie essential) things you need:
   * Python (2.6 or higher) the Python Interpreter
   * Numpy (1.0 or higher) numerical modules
   * Scipy (0.5 or higher) scientific computing
   * Matplotlib (0.87 or higher) plotting 
   * PyTables for working with hdf files
     * note pytables uses numexpr so you need that too
   * h5py, a similiar hdf file interface
   * Python Imaging Library (PIL) for working with image files

* The following are good addons
   * wxPython for building graphical user interfaces 
      * get the unicode version. 
   * Pythoncard interface to wxPython for gui programming
   * pyreadline


To install tdl into python/.../site-packages just exectute:
>>python setup.py install

To run tdl from a non-standard location (e.g. your devel directory) just make sure that the 
root directory is on the PYTHONPATH.  E.g. if you copy this package to: c:\user\bob\devel\tdl
then add c:\user\bob\devel to the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

In either case for installation you may want to add ../tdl/scripts to your system path to access the command line utilities.
