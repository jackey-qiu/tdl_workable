Modules/Plugins that use a shared library should live here, then install .dll/.so/.dylib to appropriate plugin folder

For Windows:
   > conf/use_mingw.bat
 You may need tweaking to point to your installation of MinGW and Msys.

For Mac OSX:  You may need to tweak conf/Mk.darwin to point to your gfortran installation,
   or modify and run conf/Build_UniversalGFortran_Darwin.sh to build Universal Gfortran libs

For each directory:
  cd Directory
  python ../configure.py
  make install
